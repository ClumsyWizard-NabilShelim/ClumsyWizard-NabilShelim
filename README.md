# My name is Nabil Shelim.
Hey there! I'm a self-taught programmer with a love for all things game development. Over the past 8 years, I've taken my passion for programming and turned it into a full-blown obsession with creating games. And let me tell you, it's been an exciting ride!

I've got a solid background in Unity game engine, but I love to branch out and try new things. Hence, I have also dabbled in the world of Godot and Unreal Engine

I've worked with all sorts of clients and startup indie studios, lending my expertise to bring their **Game Ideas** to **life**. And as a freelancer, I get the thrill of taking on new projects and challenges all the time.
