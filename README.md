<h1>My name is Nabil Shelim.</h1>

I'm a self-taught programmer from Bangladesh who loves both making and playing video games. I have been programming for about 4 years, using both the Unity and the Godot game engine. In terms of programming, I have been programming in both C# and C++ programming languages. I enjoy making games because I get to do the technical and nitty-gritty things related to making a game and also because I get to partially experience what goes into making such awesome games out there.

<h2>My expertise</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable at programming with C# and C++.</i>

<li>Very comfortable and efficient at using the Unity Game Engine, as I have been using it for more than 5 years. You can check out the games I have made over here: [Games](https://clumsywizard.itch.io/)</i>

<li>Good understanding of the Godot Game Engine.</i>
 </ul>
